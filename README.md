# iptracker
This is a discord bot that tracks IP addresses

# Creator
This bot was created by xXNotZeroTwoXx (Beluga#4765).

# How it Works
This bot basically generates random numbers and decimals until it finds an ip. The bot then pings the ip to see if it can grab it or not. If the bot can grab the ip then it will put the ip into a database.
